### This code was used in [UWMGI Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/uw-madison-gi-tract-image-segmentation/) challenge on Kaggle.

> It includes scripts, notebooks, and zip of original [smp](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch) library.  
> I have forked the smp codebase and pushed the modifications [here](https://github.com/sanchitvj/segmentation_models.pytorch).  

Some of the pending updates will be pushed soon.
